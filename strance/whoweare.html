    <h1>Who We Are</h1>

    <h2>Strance</h2>

    <div class="container profile-image">
    <p>Strance is an organization of awesomeness. We have been in existance for over 10 years providing the best in the global fitness and dance cultures. Before we opened our doors in 2010, we didn't have a name. It was during that time, the birth of Stance (the merging of strength and dance) evolved and we were so excited of our name and the unique flavor of what we do.</p> 
        

    <p>Therefore, itâ€™s only natural that our site features a compilation of the various dance and fitness classes offered, pictures, definitions and so forth. We strive to keep you, our customer informed and in mind in all that we do.</p> 
            
    <p>Our population is as diversed as our classes and the teams' years of expertise is the highest around. Many of our students, by choice, have gone on to further their dance and exercise careers which is another reason to continue to better serve you.</p>
    
    <p>We are so excited you decided to visit.</p>
